## WHITE PAPER  
### On Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust  

---

### 1. INTRODUCTION  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developing fast. It will change our lives by improving healthcare (e.g., making diagnosis more precise, enabling better prevention of diseases), increasing the efficiency of farming, contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, improving the efficiency of production systems through predictive maintenance, increasing the security of Europeans, and in many other ways that we can only begin to imagine. 

At the same time, AI entails a number of potential risks, such as opaque decision-making, gender-based or other kinds of discrimination, intrusion in our private lives, or being used for criminal purposes. 

Against a background of fierce global competition, a solid European approach is needed, building on the European strategy for AI presented in April 2018. To address the opportunities and challenges of AI, the EU must act as one and define its own way, based on European values, to promote the development and deployment of AI.

The Commission is committed to enabling scientific breakthroughs, preserving the EU’s technological leadership, and ensuring that new technologies are at the service of all Europeans – improving their lives while respecting their rights. 

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in her political guidelines a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI as well as a reflection on the better use of big data for innovation. 

Thus, the Commission supports a regulatory and investment-oriented approach with the twin objective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain uses of this new technology. The purpose of this White Paper is to set out policy options on how to achieve these objectives. It does not address the development and use of AI for military purposes. The Commission invites Member States, other European institutions, and all stakeholders, including industry, social partners, civil society organisations, researchers, the public in general, and any interested party, to react to the options below and to contribute to the Commission’s future decision-making in this domain.

### 2. CAPITALISING ON STRENGTHS IN INDUSTRIAL AND PROFESSIONAL MARKETS  
Europe is well placed to benefit from the potential of AI, not only as a user but also as a creator and a producer of this technology. It has excellent research centres, innovative start-ups, a world-leading position in robotics, and competitive manufacturing and services sectors, from automotive to healthcare, energy, financial services, and agriculture. 

Europe has developed a strong computing infrastructure (e.g., high-performance computers), essential to the functioning of AI. Europe also holds large volumes of public and industrial data, the potential of which is currently under-used. It has well-recognised industrial strengths in safe and secure digital systems with low-power consumption that are essential for the further development of AI. 

Harnessing the capacity of the EU to invest in next-generation technologies and infrastructures, as well as in digital competences like data literacy, will increase Europe’s technological sovereignty in key enabling technologies and infrastructures for the data economy.

The infrastructures should support the creation of European data pools enabling trustworthy AI, e.g., AI based on European values and rules. Europe should leverage its strengths to expand its position in the ecosystems and along the value chain, from certain hardware manufacturing sectors to software all the way to services. This is already happening to an extent. Europe produces more than a quarter of all industrial and professional service robots (e.g., for precision farming, security, health, logistics), and plays an important role in developing and using software applications for companies and organisations.

Over half of the top manufacturers in Europe implement at least one instance of AI in manufacturing operations. One reason for Europe’s strong position in terms of research is the EU funding programme that has proven instrumental in pooling action, avoiding duplications, and leveraging public and private investments in the Member States. Over the past three years, EU funding for research and innovation for AI has risen to €1.5 billion, i.e., a 70% increase compared to the previous period. 

However, investment in research and innovation in Europe is still a fraction of the public and private investment in other regions of the world. Some €3.2 billion was invested in AI in Europe in 2016, compared to around €12.1 billion in North America and €6.5 billion in Asia. In response, Europe needs to increase its investment levels significantly. The Coordinated plan on AI developed with Member States is proving to be a good starting point in building closer cooperation on AI in Europe and in creating synergies to maximize investment in the AI value chain.

### 3. SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD: THE NEXT DATA WAVE  
Although Europe currently is in a weaker position in consumer applications and online platforms, which results in a competitive disadvantage in data access, major shifts in the value and re-use of data across sectors are underway. The volume of data produced in the world is growing rapidly, from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to an expected 175 zettabytes in 2025. Each new wave of data brings opportunities for Europe to position itself in the data-agile economy and to become a world leader in this area.

Furthermore, the way in which data are stored and processed will change dramatically over the coming five years. Today, 80% of data processing and analysis that takes place in the cloud occurs in data centres and centralised computing facilities, and 20% in smart connected objects, such as cars, home appliances, or manufacturing robots, and in computing facilities close to the user (edge computing). By 2025, these proportions are set to change markedly.

Europe is a global leader in low-power electronics, which is key for the next generation of specialised processors for AI. This market is currently dominated by non-EU players. This could change with the help of initiatives such as the European Processor Initiative, which focuses on developing low-power computing systems for both edge and next-generation high-performance computing.

### 4. AN ECOSYSTEM OF EXCELLENCE  
To build an ecosystem of excellence that can support the development and uptake of AI across the EU economy and public administration, there is a need to step up action at multiple levels.

#### A. WORKING WITH MEMBER STATES  
Delivering on its strategy on AI adopted in April 2018, in December 2018 the Commission presented a Coordinated Plan - prepared together with the Member States - to foster the development and use of AI in Europe. This plan proposes some 70 joint actions for closer and more efficient cooperation between Member States and the Commission in key areas, such as research, investment, market uptake, skills and talent, data, and international cooperation. The plan is scheduled to run until 2027, with regular monitoring and review.

**Action 1:** The Commission, taking into account the results of the public consultation on the White Paper, will propose to the Member States a revision of the Coordinated Plan to be adopted by end 2020.

EU-level funding in AI should attract and pool investment in areas where the action required goes beyond what any single Member State can achieve. The objective is to attract over €20 billion of total investment in the EU per year in AI over the next decade. To stimulate private and public investment, the EU will make available resources from the Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe as well as from the European Structural and Investment Funds to address the needs of less-developed regions as well as rural areas.

The Coordinated Plan could also address societal and environmental well-being as a key principle for AI. AI systems promise to help tackle the most pressing concerns, including climate change and environmental degradation. It is also important that this happens in an environmentally friendly manner. AI can and should itself critically examine resource usage and energy consumption and be trained to make choices that are positive for the environment. The Commission will consider options to encourage and promote AI solutions that do this together with the Member States.

### 5. AN ECOSYSTEM OF TRUST: REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR AI  
As with any new technology, the use of AI brings both opportunities and risks. Citizens fear being left powerless in defending their rights and safety when facing the information asymmetries of algorithmic decision-making, and companies are concerned about legal uncertainty. 

While AI can help protect citizens' security and enable them to enjoy their fundamental rights, citizens also worry that AI can have unintended effects or even be used for malicious purposes. These concerns need to be addressed. Moreover, in addition to a lack of investment and skills, lack of trust is a main factor holding back a broader uptake of AI.

That is why the Commission set out an AI strategy on 25 April 2018 addressing the socioeconomic aspects in parallel with an increase in investment in research, innovation, and AI capacity across the EU. It agreed on a Coordinated Plan with the Member States to align strategies. The Commission also established a High-Level Expert Group that published Guidelines on trustworthy AI in April 2019. 

The Commission published a Communication welcoming the seven key requirements identified in the Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group:  
- Human agency and oversight
- Technical robustness and safety  
- Privacy and data governance  
- Transparency  
- Diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness  
- Societal and environmental well-being  
- Accountability  

In addition, the Guidelines contain an assessment list for practical use by companies. During the second half of 2019, over 350 organisations tested this assessment list and sent feedback. The High-Level Group is in the process of revising its guidelines in light of this feedback and will finalize this work by June 2020.

A key result of the feedback process is that while a number of the requirements are already reflected in existing legal or regulatory regimes, those regarding transparency, traceability, and human oversight are not specifically covered under current legislation in many economic sectors.

On top of this set of non-binding Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group, and in line with the President’s political guidelines, a clear European regulatory framework would build trust among consumers and businesses in AI, and therefore speed up the uptake of the technology. 

This regulatory framework should be consistent with other actions to promote Europe’s innovation capacity and competitiveness in this field.

### 6. CONCLUSION  
AI is a strategic technology that offers many benefits for citizens, companies, and society as a whole, provided it is human-centric, ethical, sustainable, and respects fundamental rights and values. AI offers important efficiency and productivity gains that can strengthen the competitiveness of European industry and improve the well-being of citizens. It can also contribute to finding solutions to some of the most pressing societal challenges, including the fight against climate change and environmental degradation, the challenges linked to sustainability and demographic changes, and the protection of our democracies and, where necessary and proportionate, the fight against crime.

For Europe to seize fully the opportunities that AI offers, it must develop and reinforce the necessary industrial and technological capacities. A s set out in the accompanying European strategy for data, this also requires measures that will enable the EU to become a global hub for data.

The European approach for AI aims to promote Europe’s innovation capacity in the area of AI while supporting the development and uptake of ethical and trustworthy AI across the EU economy. AI should work for people and be a force for good in society.
